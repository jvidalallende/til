# Contributing

This repository is essentially a public record of my learning journey.

Although pull requests that fix typos or links are welcome, I prefer to keep it as personal project,
and therefore **content contributions are unlikely to be accepted**.

If you want to add a tutorial for anything, try to look for a better upstream place (e.g. your
project's wikis, documentation repositories, etc.). And if you just learned something, what about
starting your own TIL repo?
