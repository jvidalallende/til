# Export draw.io diagrams so they can be edited

The diagramming tool [draw.io][00] allows [exporting diagrams][03] to several output formats.

If the output format allows storing metadata within it (like `.png`, `.svg`, or `pdf`),
be sure to tick the **Include a copy of my diagram** checkbox. By doing this, you will
be able to edit the diagram by importing the output file within `draw.io` again.

If you use the online editor, [there are further sharing options available][01].

Note that some raster formats like `.jpg`, `webp` [do not support embedded metadata][02].

**Tip:** add a prefix to the extension, e.g. `my_diagram.drawio.png` to indicate others that you
used this tool, they may know about it and hence be able to properly import and edit the diagram
if needed.
